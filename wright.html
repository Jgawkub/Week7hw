        <p>Where it all began. The Wright Flyer first flown on December 17th, 1903 was the culmination of two years of testing with gliders. Although the longest flight lasted only 59 seconds and covered a distance of 852 feet, shorter than some wingspans of contemporary airliners, the impact would be undeniable. Man would land on th moon only 63 years later.  </p>
