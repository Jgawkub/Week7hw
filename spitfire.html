            The Supermarine Spitfire remains one of the recognizeable British aircraft of the Second World War. First flown in 1936, it's all metal construction was a radical departure from earlier fabric covered aircraft. It's reputation was cemented when it defended the U.K. from attack during the Battle of Britain. With over 24 variants produced it's reputation is well desevred.
